## Description

This project is a command-line application built using Node.js that dynamically generates a professional README.md file for a user's project. The goal is to automate the process of creating a high-quality README.md file, which is essential for any open-source project on GitHub.The application prompts the user with a series of questions, covering various aspects such as project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, choice of license, GitHub username, and email address. Based on the user's responses, it generates a README.md file that includes all the necessary sections and information.
